# Nifty-50-prediction
The code is designed to predict short-term stock trends for the Nifty 50 index using a machine learning approach. The following sections detail each stage of the code, from data collection to feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

To use the code
1. Download the Vix_Prediction_of_the_stock_market.
2. 2.Open Google Colab > go to File > Upload Notebook, or you can also use Jupyter Notebook to run the code (I prefer Colab because you donâ€™t have to go through the hassle of downloading libraries).
3. I have  also add the code in txt file just in case.

To increase the precision, you can play around with the n_estimators, u could also add more data like the Snp 500 and other sectors.


This is my first repository comment. If I made any mistakes or if you have any queries, please let me know.
